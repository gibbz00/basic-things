# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

* If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, then please disclose it as a security advisory [here](https://github.com/GITHUB_PATH/security/advisories/new).
* Do not reveal the problem to others until it has been resolved, or when 90 days have passed since the security advisory was first created.
* Do not take advantage of the vulnerability problem you have discovered.

## Supported Versions

The security policy applies to all versions, but security updates will only be added as parts of a new release. The same goes for bug fixes of any kind.
